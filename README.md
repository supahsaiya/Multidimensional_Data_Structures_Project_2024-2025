# Multidimensional-Data-Structures---Project-2024-2025

Multi-dimensional Data Indexing and Similarity Query Processing:
Development of Multidimensional Access Methods based on k-d trees, quad trees, Range
Trees and R-trees respectively to support k-dimensional queries. 
After the 1st phase of indexing, in a 2nd phase, we perform similarity queries according to a specific textual
attribute (f.e. review comments, etc) based on LSH technique. The final task is an
exhausted evaluation performance comparison among the 4 proposed schemes: k-d
+ LSH, Quad + LSH, Range + LSH, R-trees + LSH.

Using the Coffee Reviews Dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmoyote/coffee-reviews-dataset)
